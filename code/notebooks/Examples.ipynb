    "# Examples Notebook for `fn_package` â€“ A Python Package for a Modular Multi-Agent System\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository provides the codebase for a modular multi-agent system designed for **document retrieval, memory management, and code execution** in Python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project was to build an **easily extensible and modular agent system** using only standard Python, without relying on external frameworks. This choice was made for **educational purposes**, to ensure transparency and a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the package at a high level.  \n",
    "For details on the individual components, consult the `README.md` file or explore the package code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This notebook serves as **documentation** rather than a playground.\n"
